    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: October 7, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>ACSTRK</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”). Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our website, mobile applications, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> When you register, sign in, fill out forms, contact support, or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, profile information, and any other content you choose to submit.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically collected information:</strong> When you use the Services, we automatically collect data such as IP address, device identifiers, browser type, operating system, crash reports, usage statistics, timestamps, and analytics data.</li>
      <li><strong>Information from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about you from third-party services (for example, analytics providers, advertising partners, or social login providers) in accordance with their terms and your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the Services;</li>
      <li>Authenticating and managing user accounts;</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following circumstances:</p>

      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we may transfer information to the acquiring entity as permitted by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> When required by law, regulation, legal process, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of others.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregate or de-identified:</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified data that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</li>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may link to or integrate third-party services (such as analytics tools, advertising networks, or social platforms). Those third parties have their own privacy policies and practices. We encourage you to review their policies before providing personal information to them.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the information we collect. While we make efforts to safeguard your data, no security measure is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When data is no longer needed, we will delete or anonymize it in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
